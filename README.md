  The Tic-Tac-Toe game is a Python-based application that simulates the classic two-player strategy game played on a 3×3 grid. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, functions, and user input handling.

The game allows two players to take turns marking X and O on the grid, with built-in logic to check for valid moves, winning conditions, and draw situations. The program provides a simple and interactive console interface, making it easy for users to play and understand.

This project helped in strengthening problem-solving skills and understanding of basic game logic implementation in Python. It can be further enhanced by adding features such as a single-player mode with AI, graphical user interface (GUI), or score tracking system
